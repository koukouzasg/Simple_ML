# Simple_ML
Repo with simple implementations of wide known classification methods

# The methods implemented are 
 - K-Neighbours.
 - Naive Bayes Classifier.
 - Multilayered Perceptron with one and two hidden layers.
 - Support Vector Machine with linear and gaussian kernels.

Apart from the files with the implemented methods, they is also a utils file for common used functions.

The code could be further refactored, and may try to impove the accuracy of the methods in the future.
The dataset used for the testing of the methods is this : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/
